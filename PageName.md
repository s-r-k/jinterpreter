## Every object has a **Prototype** ##


## You can add methods and attributes to an object's **Prototype** ##


## Anything assigned to an object's prototype becomes available to all instances of that constructor via the this object ##


## You can modify an object's prototype at any time in your program ##


## Prototype is an object shared by all instances of a lets say a constructor ##


## It forms part of a lookup chain: any time you attempt to access a property of Person that isn't set, JavaScript will check Person.prototype to see if that property exists there instead. As a result, anything assigned to Person.prototype becomes available to all instances of that constructor via the this object. ##


## You can add extra methods to existing objects at runtime ##
