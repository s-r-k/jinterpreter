The best way to learn how interpreters and runtime environments work is by actually attempting to write one. So inspired by Rhino I decided to start writing my own interpreter based on the ECMA Script specification.But it turned out that writing one for ECMAScript is too ambitious for a novice like me. So now I am into Scheme and trying to write one for Scheme.SICP's chapter on meta linguistic abstractions offers a good starting point.
